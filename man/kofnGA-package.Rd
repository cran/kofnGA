\title{kofnGA: A genetic algorithm for selection of fixed-size subsets.}
\description{
A genetic algorithm (GA) to do subset selection:  search for a subset of a fixed size,
k, from the integers 1:n, such that user-supplied function is minimized at that subset.
}
\details{
This package provides the function \code{\link[kofnGA]{kofnGA}}, which implements a GA to perform
subset selection; that is, choosing the best \emph{k} elements from among \emph{n}
possibilities. We label the set of possibilities from which we are choosing by the integers
\code{1:n}, and a solution is represented by an index vector, i.e., a vector of integers in
the range [1, n] (with no duplicates) indicating which members of the set to choose. The
objective function (defining which solution is \dQuote{best}) is arbitrary and user-supplied;
the only restriction on this function is that its first argument must be an index vector
encoding the solution.

The search results output by \code{kofnGA} are a list object assigned to the S3 class
\code{GAsearch}. The package includes \code{summary}, \code{print}, and \code{plot} methods
for this class to make it easier to inspect the results.
