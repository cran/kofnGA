Description: Provides a function that uses a genetic algorithm to search for a subset
 of size k from the integers 1:n, such that a user-supplied objective function 
 is minimized at that subset.  The selection step is done by tournament selection 
 based on ranks, and elitism may be used to retain a portion of the best solutions 
 from one generation to the next. Population objective function values may 
 optionally be evaluated in parallel.
